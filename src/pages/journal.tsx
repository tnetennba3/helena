    <p>
      I am currently learning Japanese and have spent a lot of time consuming
      the language. Whether thatâ€™s hearing my mum scold me as a child, watching
      TV shows, or more recently,{" "}
      <Link to="/blog/i-read-my-first-book-in-japanese/">reading books</Link>.
      But I don't get much practice actually using the language.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, I have set myself the goal to write in Japanese every day. Every
      morning, I set a timer for ten minutes and see what I can write in that
      time. There are bound to be a lot of mistakes here. At some point, I might
      go back and see if I can correct each post. But for now, I think I will
      get a lot out of just forcing myself to write. And hopefully, as I get
      better at writing, it will be motivating to have a record of how far I've
      come.

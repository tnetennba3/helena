      This is where I write in Japanese.{" "}

    <p>
      I am currently learning Japanese and have spent a lot of time consuming
      the language. Whether thatâ€™s hearing my mum scold me as a child, watching
      TV shows, or more recently,{" "}
      <Link to="/blog/i-read-my-first-book-in-japanese/">reading books</Link>.
      But I don't get much practice actually using the language myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      To fix that, I have set myself the goal to write in Japanese every day.
      Every morning, I set a timer for 10 minutes and just see where I can get
      to writing a journal entry. There are bound to be a lot of mistakes here.
      At some point, I might go back and see if I can improve on them. But for
      now, I think I will get a lot out of just forcing myself to write. And
      hopefully, as I get better at writing, it will be motivating to have a
      record of how far I've come.

a good time to stop, reflect over my journey and consider what I’ve learnt. I
started on 19th April 2020 and since then I’ve dedicated 1,378 hours to studying
(according to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://productivitychallengetimer.com/&quot;&gt;timer app&lt;/a&gt;). That’s
just over 25 hours a week, quite a lot on top of a full time job. In this post,
I will try to justify how I spent that much time on one hobby (neglecting
everything else in my life) as well as point people to the resources I used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How did I learn Japanese?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Setting goals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m one of those cool kids that likes to set goals for myself even outside of
work. So in order to make sure I was taking Japanese seriously, I set some goals
up front. A lot of these were around passing a set of exams called the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jlpt.jp/e/about/index.html&quot;&gt;JLPT (Japanese-Language Proficiency Test)&lt;/a&gt;.
Unfortunately, I couldn’t take these in person (because of the whole COVID
thing) but I did take the mock papers on the dates I set in advance. Happily, I
&amp;quot;passed&amp;quot; N5 with a result of 91% in July, N4 with 91% in August and N3 with 80%
in December. I’m planning to take a mock N2 test on July 4th, the day the exam
would have happened in London if it hadn’t been cancelled. And hopefully, I’ll
be able to take the real thing in December and have a shiny certificate to show
for it (plus, validate all the work I put in).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other goal I set for myself way back in April 2020 was to read and finish
Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, in Japanese, by the end of the year.
Frankly, it took me ages to do so, but I did finish the book and
&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/i-read-my-first-book-in-japanese/&quot;&gt;wrote about it another blog post&lt;/a&gt; to
celebrate the occassion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-figure&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Learning how to learn&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the very beginning, I spent a good deal of time researching how to learn
Japanese. Being a spoiled native English speaker, my main exposure to formal
language learning was (not really) learning German at school. My first baby
step, therefore, was to learm how to learn. On one of my internet explorations,
I found a 177 page
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/10bRzVblKVOsQJjTc2PIi1Gbj_LrsJCkMkh0SutXCZdI/edit&quot;&gt;Google Doc&lt;/a&gt;
that detailed the author’s experience learning Japanese and their recommended
approach. It’s packed with information so I suggest checking it out if you want
to learn Japanese and don’t know where to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After &lt;del&gt;reading&lt;/del&gt; skimming over this document, I started to reframe what
learning Japanese actually meant. Before, I had this idea that I would be
training a particular skill (the ability to Japanese?) But it turns out language
acquisition is a bit more complex than that and includes multiple skills. There
are passive skills, such as listening and reading, which determine how well you
can understand Japanese in different settings. As well as active skills,
speaking and writing, which determine how well you can communciate. Underpinning
all these skills are the building blocks of the language, grammar and
vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structuring my language learning around these building blocks and skills allowed
me to allocate my time most effectively. Early on, I decided to prioritise
listening and reading over speaking and writing. I knew it would be much easier
to find Japanese audio and text than it is to befriend people who could speak
the language, something I wasn’t yet confident enough to do. I could also shift
my focus depending on the parts of the language I was weakest at. This was an
ongoing analysis that I could do, say, when I was reading a book and noticed
that I was spending more time looking up kanji and vocab than I was on grammar
points. Or when I struggled to understand a sentence when it was written down
but could comprehend it instantly when it was spoken aloud in an audiobook.
These kind of observations meant that I could continually tweak my study plan to
get the most out of learning Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-figure&quot;&gt;

    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-figcaption&quot;&gt;How I allocated my 1,378 hours of learning Japanese.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Kanji and vocabulary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent a significant chunk (nearly 600 hours) of my time learning kanji and
vocabulary. It was the area I spent the most time in because kanji is simply the
hardest part of the language, and one where I didn’t have a head start in. There
are thousands of kanji characters and it’s one of the reasons why Japanese is
considered
&lt;a href=&quot;https://effectivelanguagelearning.com/language-guide/language-difficulty/&quot;&gt;the hardest language for a native English speaker to learn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I researched a few ways I could learn kanji and ultimately decided on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wanikani.com/&quot;&gt;WaniKani&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a web app that teaches kanji and
vocabulary using mnemonics and spaced repetition. It’s quite pricey ($299 for a
lifetime subscription) but, unlike free resources, everything is laid out for
you. All you need to do is turn up, learn some stuff and try to progress to the
next level. As you progress through the levels and finally take down the boss at
level 60 (the boss &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be made-up), you’ll have learned over 2000 kanji.
You’ll have also learned 8000 supplementary vocabulary which contain the kanji
you learned and are there to solidify your knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually reached level 60 a week ago! I still have a ton of items to review
but have otherwise completed the course. Having just over 2000 kanji floating
around my brain is a massive help when I want to read practically anything.
There are still quite a lot of characters that I encounter in the wild that I
don’t know. But I am confident I have the tools to learn more kanji once I come
across them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-figure&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Grammar&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to kanji and vocabulary, I didn’t spend a significant amount of time
studying grammar. In fact I only spent 90 hours doing so. Thankfully, I already
had an inuitive understanding of common grammar patterns that was ingrained in
me from when I was a child. So when I didn’t understand something, very rarely
was it because of my lack of familiarity with the grammar. Instead, it was
usually because I had no idea what the kanji characters were or what the
vocabulary meant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I did study grammar, I used textbooks (because that was what the internet
suggested). I went through the very popular
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10833581-genki-i&quot;&gt;Genki I&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12899848-genki-ii&quot;&gt;Genki II&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6618452-tobira?from_search=true&amp;amp;from_srp=true&amp;amp;qid=Uco4yDM1AR&amp;amp;rank=1&quot;&gt;Tobira&lt;/a&gt;
textbooks, in that order. They roughly teach N5, N4 and N3 level grammar
respectively. Up next, I have the &lt;span lang=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;新完全マスター文法 日本語能力試験
N2&lt;/span&gt;
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25617186-n2&quot;&gt;New Kanzen Master Grammar JLPT N2&lt;/a&gt;)
textbook which I will dive into soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Listening&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent around 320 hours listening to Japanese in the past year. In the
beginning, it was a skill far beyond my reading ability so it was a way to
immerse myself in Japanese without having to do too much studying up front. I
started with a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1QpZdCHHoA&amp;amp;list=PLDKkKPYyoB3ANuP72zvJClW2zHcpF5prO&quot;&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s Play series on Stardew Valley&lt;/a&gt;.
It’s a game I’ve spent hundreds of hours on so I could pick up a lot of words
just from the context. It was nice to be able to wind down in the evening and
feel like I’m studying when all I’m doing is watching someone play Stardew
Valley. I also listened to a lot of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stitcher.com/show/small-talk-in-japanese&quot;&gt;&amp;#x27;Let’s learn Japanese from small talk!&amp;#x27; (podcast)&lt;/a&gt;
when I was cooking and watched a bunch of anime when I was eating. (As an aside,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.animefeminist.com/anifem-recommends/&quot;&gt;AnimeFeminist&lt;/a&gt; is a great
place to discover feminist-friendly anime, if you care about that sort of
thing.) I even rewatched all of The Good Place with Japanese audio — highly
recommend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reading&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent a similar amount on reading (314 hours) as I did on listening. I’m still
better at understanding spoken Japanese than I am written Japanese but I have
made huge strides in the past year. At the start, I could barely read hiragana
and katakana (kanji isn’t the only writing system, just the hardest) and would
struggle to read a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/&quot;&gt;NHK Easy News&lt;/a&gt; article.
Now, I’m able to read whole books in Japanese and read my latest, the third in
the Kiki’s Delivery Service series, at 68% of audiobook speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m still planning to read two books a month this year. I’ve read four so far,
so am a bit behind. But, I’m hoping to catch up as my reading speed improves. I
also have a backlog of video games I’d like to get through at some point which
will definitely challenge my reading ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-figure&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Speaking&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty much the only person I speak to in Japanese is my mum. I’ve spent 27
hours speaking Japanese in the past year so that’s 27 hours on the phone with my
mum. I’ve definitely improved since I started, but I think that’s mostly down to
how much time I’ve spent in the other areas of my study. Going forward, I might
try to find a tutor on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.italki.com/?hl=en&quot;&gt;italki&lt;/a&gt; and even attempt
to talk to strangers on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hellotalk.com/?lang=en&quot;&gt;HelloTalk&lt;/a&gt;,
whenever I pluck up the courage to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Writing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, writing is the skill that I’ve dedicated the least amount of time on
(15 hours). I had planned to &lt;a href=&quot;/journal/&quot;&gt;write a journal entry every day&lt;/a&gt; but I
kind of fell out of habit on that one. At some point I will pick it up again but
it is hard. As much as I can comprehend a fair amount when I’m listening or
reading, being able to produce coherent Japanese on the fly is something I need
more practice at. In terms of handwriting Japanese, I haven’t spent any time on
it at all. Most of my life is spent on the computer and I barely handwrite in
English anyway. So it’s on the bottom of my list of priorities at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-figure&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Am I fluent?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common question I get when I tell people I’m learning Japanese is, &amp;quot;Are
you fluent?&amp;quot; It seems like a fair question to ask, especially given the amount
of time I’ve spent on it. A quick Google search for &amp;quot;how long does it take to be
fluent in a language&amp;quot; will give top answers in the range of 200 to 720 hours.
So, given I’ve spent 1,328 hours studying Japanese, surely I should be fluent
many times over now, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have dedicated the next few paragraphs to explain why this isn’t the case.
Hopefully, this will set expectations for new learners and more importantly,
prove to myself that I’m not a horrendously slow learner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is fluency?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s time to question the question. &amp;#x27;Fluency&amp;#x27; is quite an abstract concept and
open to very different interpretations. Firstly, there’s the question of which
skills you need to acquire to say you’re fluent. For example, you might think
&amp;#x27;fluency&amp;#x27; only refers to your ability to verbally communicate . This makes sense
because for a long time the majority of the population were illiterate but were
still viewed as &amp;#x27;fluent&amp;#x27; in their native language. On the other hand, not
knowing how to read or write in your target language does feel a bit incomplete.
There are also other aspects to communicating successfully beyond language, such
as gestures and cultural etiquette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, there’s the question of what mastery you need attain to be classed as
&amp;#x27;fluent&amp;#x27;. Conversational fluency, in which you are able to converse on everyday
topics (with room for mistakes), is a far cry from being able to eloquently
express yourself on a range of complex topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would argue that the term &amp;#x27;fluency&amp;#x27; isn’t a very helpful term for measuring
language acquistion at all. It’s too ambiguous and highly contextual. You might
have a near faultless exchange with a native speaker about the weather, which
convinces them that you’re fluent. But that evening, the waiter at a restaurant
gives you an English menu after seeing the panic on your face trying to decipher
Japanese text. In these situations, being perceived as &amp;#x27;fluent&amp;#x27; is a fleeting
state that you can attain or lose depending on the context and who you’re with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I think about how I’m progressing with Japanese, I always compare my
Japanese with my English. This does set unachievable standards for acquiring
Japanese. I already have 25 years of practice with English and still use it more
frequently than I do Japanese. So it’s unlikely my Japanese will ever surpass my
English. However, setting the bar at where my native language stands does make
my North Star a lot less ambiguous. It also exposes the sheer amount of time
learning a new language takes, which is often glossed over or outright
fabricated by marketers trying to sell you something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I can feel good about reading a book in Japanese or having a
conversation with my mum but I don’t delude myself into thinking, &amp;quot;That’s it! I
have mastered the language now.&amp;quot; If I had tried to read the same sorts of things
I do in English, such as technical books, or talk about the same sorts of things
I do in English, such as philosophy or politics, I wouldn’t know where to start.
Even writing this same blog post in Japanese seems like an impossible feat or at
least, would take me several more years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I guess a better answer to the question, &amp;quot;Are you fluent?&amp;quot; is, &amp;quot;It depends.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What else have I learned?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things I have found about the past year is that I haven’t
just learned Japanese. I have also developed a lot of other skills as a
by-product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Resilience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s worth saying that I picked up learning Japanese during the pandemic and I
truly believe it’s what helped me not only get through it and but have one of
the best years I have ever had. Someone recently said to me that developing
resilience is a lot about having a clear direction of where you want to go, even
in the midst of chaos. And that really spoke to what learning Japanese has given
me. I had clear long term goals of what I wanted to achieve from the outset and
I have, luckily, been able to focus on that even as the world fell apart around
me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Time management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;My time management and discipline is way better than I ever thought it could be.
I have been spending pretty much most of my free time studying, more than I ever
did at university (when I didn’t even have a job to distract me). One of the
things that helped me was using my timer app to time each study session. The app
gives you a superficial rank depending on how much time you’ve clocked in during
the week. As trivial as it sounds, the idea of gaining or losing a rank often
pushed me to study, even on days when I was more reluctant to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Enjoyment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, I found that I actually enjoy studying Japanese and the slow
grind to get marginally better at the language every day. At the beginning, I
set my sights on the end goal, getting good at Japanese, and never considered
that I would enjoy the journey itself. In particular, I’ve really enjoyed
gamifying the learning process and tracking my progress across various metrics.
I also love that I am able to peep into another world and consume untranslated
materials, like news articles and books, that are inaccessible to most of the
world’s population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:880px&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, I highly recommend picking up a new language if you’re interested!

But as
much as it is an extremely privileged situation to be in, there are a bunch of
feelings to disentangle when you inherit a large sum of money. Especially if
you’re not used to it and don’t come from a wealthy background. You have to
navigate the grief you have for the person who has died, guilt for benefiting
from their death, and anxiety over what to do with it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want resources, there are countless articles that explain the
administrative process of what to do when someone dies. And there are many other
dry personal finance articles that assume you want to maximise your return on
your inheritance money. But I couldn’t find much out there that touch on the
emotional side of inheritance. So that’s why I want to break the silence and
describe the journey I went through. I also ended up doing something a bit
unusual and not often talked about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 1st November 2019, my grandmother, Annai, died in a care home. We knew it was
coming. She had been suffering from Alzheimer’s for a while. Before then, she
had lived a long and mostly comfortable life. That was one consolation. In a
way, we were also thankful that she passed away when she did. Just a few months
later, and she could have been caught up in the pandemic. Like so many others,
she could have died alone and with no one to mourn her at her funeral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long after her death, my gran’s solicitor contacted my parents. They were
appointed executors and that meant they were responsible for carrying out the
wishes in my gran’s will. At this point, I found out that my gran had left two
thirds of everything she had to my dad and the remaining third to me. I’m still
unsure why she chose to do what she did. It’s much more common for a parent to
leave everything to their child. I was two years old when she wrote that will.
It felt strange that she placed so much faith in me, the tiny toddler I was at
the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew my gran’s estate would be sizable. Before she moved into a care home
close to my parents, she lived in Norfolk. I would visit every Christmas as a
child. I had this impression of her as living in a completely different world to
my own with its own set of rules that I hadn’t been taught yet. I never got the
hang of laying the table correctly (I still can’t believe fish knives are a
thing) and would awe at my school friends that my grandparents had a house “with
a dining room!” But I didn’t know the specifics of how much money she actually
had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was told I would be inheriting over £200,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was shocked. I still feel overwhelmed by the sheer size of it typing it out
now. It was much more than anyone expected. My mum was the one who joyfully
shared the news with me over a phone call. But I couldn’t share that joy. The
knowledge of that money sent me spiralling into a whirlpool of questions and
emotions I was too afraid to confront.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt deep shame and guilt. I didn’t deserve this money. I hadn’t done anything
to earn it. I thought about my mum who worked as a part-time carer and cleaner
into her 60s. It was hard, physical work. Every time she would come home
exhausted, complaining how sore she was. And yet, her labour wasn’t valued. Only
with help of state support could we afford to pay rent and put food on the
table. It felt so unjust that I would have this much wealth at the age of 25
without lifting a finger for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also felt like a fraud. I had carved part of my identity as being “the poor
one” growing up especially as I was surrounded by middle-class, affluent peers.
I did become a lot more privileged once I left home. I got to attend a big name
university and later started working in a well-paying industry. I reconciled my
identity by acknowledging that I was once poor but am relatively well-off now
and extremely grateful for it. But this inheritance chucked another curve ball
at me. It felt like I’d been immediately transformed into this out-of-touch rich
kid, one of those that I used to envy at school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was because of these reasons, I decided to ignore my inheritance. I knew it
would take a while for the money to eventually be transferred. There’s a bunch
of administrative stuff that needed to happen first which could take up to a
year or two. That gave me an excuse to suppress all my feelings and pretend this
inheritance didn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I did that for about a year, I went about life as if nothing had happened. I
didn’t think about the inheritance looming around the corner and started to
forget it existed. I kept it a secret. I didn’t tell anyone except my partner
who I anxiously asked at the time, “Do you think of me differently now?” When my
parents asked what I planned to do with “my money”, I would say, “I don’t know,
it’s not my money” and change the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year after my gran died, I finally had to confront reality. The solicitor was
about to finish tying everything up and my mum was starting to ask more
demanding questions. Stuff like, whether I would be willing to give my parents
part of my inheritance so they could afford a house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The few times I did give much thought to my inheritance over the past year, I
thought about charity. To be honest, my motivations weren’t entirely selfless. I
thought giving to charity would take away some of the guilt I had. But then the
question always turned to how much I should give away. I wondered if I would
ever feel guilt-free if I kept any of it for myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I pondered over what the “normal” thing would be for someone in my position to
do (twenty-something working in London). I guessed that most people would want
to put down a large deposit for a house. It’s probably the only hope a lot of us
have in affording somewhere in this city. But again, I was already in quite a
lucky position where it was feasible that I could save up enough someday. I also
wasn’t ready to settle down yet and make such a large commitment as buying a
house. And the guilt was there too, always lurking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So my mind came back to the idea of charity. As the pandemic drew on, there was
an increasing sense of urgency to use that money to help others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reached out to the solicitor who was dealing with the estate and asked about
inheritance tax. There is inheritance tax to pay on my gran’s estate because it
is about £25,000 (number yet to be finalised) over the threshold. I knew that
any gifts to charity wouldn’t be taxed. But I assumed those gifts would have to
come out of the estate itself. There would still be tax to pay if I was the one
giving to charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solicitor confirmed my suspicions but did offer another solution. He said
that we could rewrite my gran’s will as long as it was within 2 years of her
death. This way, we could change her wishes to leave some money to charity. He
was dubious that it would be worth the savings in inheritance tax. Depending on
the size of the gift, it might involve selling stocks and shares that would be
better off holding. I told him that I intended to leave my entire share to
charity after giving what my parents needed to buy a house. He was pretty taken
aback. I realised then that it wasn’t a very standard request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began researching charities. And as I did so, I started to become more
confident in the choice I was making. I realised that this amount of money could
really make a difference to a lot of people. Well, I did know that before but
only intellectually. I was so swept up by the guilt and shame that I didn’t give
myself much space to feel anything positive about this inheritance. I told
myself I had no right to feel good about giving to charity when I wasn’t really
the one giving that money. And yet, as I thought about the possibilities of what
that money could do, I couldn’t help but start to feel hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first charity I chose was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/&quot;&gt;GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt;.
It’s one that I have followed for a while and have included in my own will.
Their mission is simple, to give cash to people living in poverty. When I first
heard about them, their mission really resonated with me. A lot of people just
need money, they don’t need to be patronised by others deciding how that money
should be spent. GiveDirectly is also recommended by groups like
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly&quot;&gt;GiveWell&lt;/a&gt; that compare the
effectiveness of different charities. I was also happy to see that they have two
response programs for those economically affected by COVID-19, one in Africa and
another in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For my two other chosen charities, I decided to look closer to home. One was
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trusselltrust.org/&quot;&gt;The Trussell Trust&lt;/a&gt;. They are a charity that
supports a network of food banks up and down the country. I chose them because,
sadly, the need for food banks is only rising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another pressing cause I wanted to support was trans folks. The UK is known
globally as a hotbed for anti-trans sentiment. A few months ago the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stonewall.org.uk/about-us/news/stonewall-statement-high-court-puberty-blockers-ruling&quot;&gt;High Court made a ruling&lt;/a&gt;
that effectively denied under-16s life-saving treatment for their crippling
gender dysphoria. I say “life-saving” because
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stonewall.org.uk/sites/default/files/trans_stats.pdf&quot;&gt;nearly half (48%) of trans people in Britain have attempted suicide&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/puberty-blockers-linked-lower-suicide-risk-transgender-people-n1122101&quot;&gt;puberty blockers have been shown to lower the risk of suicide&lt;/a&gt;.
So that’s why I chose the charity &lt;a href=&quot;https://mermaidsuk.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Mermaids&lt;/a&gt;. They
support transgender, nonbinary and gender-diverse kids by providing a secure
online community, helpline service, local groups as well as a bunch of other
services. They also work in the wider area of advocacy and activism, educating
society on gender identity and trans issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, where does everything stand now? A deed of variation is currently being
processed to rewrite my gran’s will. Instead of the estate being split by
thirds, a sum of money and an entire investment account is being allocated my
dad. The rest (about £110,000 - £115,000) is being shared between GiveDirectly
(50%), The Trussell Trust (25%) and Mermaids (25%). This means that my dad is
getting about £100k more than was originally planned. Therefore, my parents have
agreed that any money they don’t need for the house will go to those three
charities. Of course, this is an agreement based on trust, it’s not legally
binding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for me, I’m looking forward to when everything is finalised and the money
starts being distributed. I used to feel dread towards that date. I have also
let go of most of my guilt and instead am immensely grateful for the gift my
gran gave. Not only is it going to help a lot of people, but the inheritance has
forced me to think deeply about what I value and who I am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some interesting parallels to draw with my gran’s own story. She
inherited the vast majority of her wealth from a family friend when she was
still a young woman. It feels kind of poetic that the money she inherited and
stored away in assets is finally going to be released into the world and do
good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back over this journey, I don’t think I took the healthiest approach to
inheriting all this money. I probably should have confronted it earlier, spoke
to people about it, maybe even sought a therapist. But despite that, I am happy
with the end result and I know the guilt helped push me towards that. A big
learning for me is that I should embrace the guilt more, listen to what it has
to say and let it pull me where I need to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a final note, I want to highlight that this is my own story and I am in a
uniquely privileged position to be able to give all my inheritance away. If my
circumstances were different, if I had dependents, struggled to make ends meet
or had aspirations for myself that I couldn’t afford, I might have chosen
differently. The relationship you have with the person who has died also has a
huge impact on how you feel about the money. If my gran had worked her entire
life to give me this money and had specific wishes for how I should use it, I
might have gone along with that.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[I read my first book in Japanese 🎉]]></title><description><![CDATA[My 2020 goal was to read Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone (or ハリー・ポッターと賢者の石) by the end of the year.

I set myself an objective
to read Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone (or &lt;span lang=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;ハリ
ー&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;・&lt;/span&gt;ポッターと賢者の石&lt;/span&gt;) by the end of 2020. Two weeks
ago, I accomplished this goal. In this post, I describe my journey so far,
approach to reading, and will present some fun stats and graphs I recorded along
the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in April, I suddenly found myself with a lot more time on my hands. The UK
was under strict lockdown. Not having to commute to work, socialise, or even go
outside at all, meant I gained several hours a day. At first, I spent all that
extra time playing Animal Crossing (&lt;small&gt;200 hours within the first month of
its release&lt;/small&gt;). On my third attempt to landscape my Animal Crossing
island, I stopped. I was wasting an opportunity. If there was any time to
reignite my interest in learning Japanese, this was it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-figure&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;My previous attempts to study the language were largely unsuccessful. I dabbled
a bit with language learning apps and lost interest quite quickly. Even though I
am fortunate enough to understand a fair amount of Japanese already (thanks,
mum), I just didn’t have much experience or confidence in being able to acquire
a new language. My time learning French and German at school taught me that I
could rote-learn vocabulary lists, memorise a script by heart and get decent
exam results. But I didn’t retain any of that information a month later let
alone years after I left school. The lesson I took away from it all was that
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I just wasn’t suited to languages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Plus, I didn’t find it very interesting
either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I was committed to give learning Japanese a proper go. It felt
like I would be foresaking my heritage if I didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, my self-directed language learning journey began with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;learning how to
learn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I quickly realised, though it should have been obvious before, that
picking up a second language isn’t anything special. Most sources say that over
half of the world’s population is multilingual. Clearly, I didn’t need to be
gifted or attuned to languages. I just needed time, dedication, and effective
learning methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also discovered that it isn’t generally recommended to learn a language in the
way I was taught at school. Rote-learning vocabulary lists and studying
textbooks only get you so far. At some point you need to confront what you’ve
learned in the real world. This can transform the vague, tenuous connections you
have between foreign sounds and meaning in your native language into something
concrete and meaningful in its own right. It’s that extra step between knowing
that the bunch of lines &lt;span lang=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;青&lt;/span&gt; can mean “green” &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; “blue”
and having the correct colour wash over you, without thought, when seeing that
character in context. For that, you need to immerse yourself in the language and
be exposed to the vast variety of ways each kanji, word, grammar point, etc. can
be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach to language learning seemed very appealing. If I could pick up
Japanese just by reading stuff in Japanese and listening to stuff in Japanese,
that sounds like I could actually enjoy myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of April, I set my focus on improving my reading ability. Doing so
would unlock a whole world of material to immerse myself in. But I was starting
from pretty much square one. Japanese has three writing systems - hiragana,
katakana and kanji. The first two I knew well enough at the time, there are only
46 characters in each. Kanji, on the other hand, is a whole other beast and has
thousands of characters with multiple ways to read and understand each of them.
I was familiar with about 20 kanji at the time. The average Japanese adult can
read &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;over 3000&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, knowing that I wanted to get better at reading, I just needed a direction to
work towards. This goal of reading Harry Potter became my lighthouse and gave
purpose to all the other studies I was undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I didn’t just spend the past 8 months slowly working through the
book. Before I could even get started on the first page, I spent half a year
buried in textbooks, reading short form text such as
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/&quot;&gt;NHK Easy News&lt;/a&gt; articles, and reviewing kanji
and vocab using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition&quot;&gt;spaced repetition&lt;/a&gt; techiques.
In future, I might write another post going over the resources and methods I
used in more detail. But for now, I’ll focus on how I tackled reading my first
book in Japanese. &lt;span role=&quot;img&quot; aria-label=&quot;Book&quot;&gt;📖&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Harry Potter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning a new language unlocks a whole new world of rich content to explore.
It’s the reason a lot of people study a new language in the first place. So, you
might be wondering why I chose a book that’s originally written in English. A
story I’m already very familiar with and wouldn’t be getting much out of by
reading it again in its impure, translated form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discovering a new narrative wasn’t the reason I chose Harry Potter. I simply
wanted to get better at Japanese. And it’s much easier to get started with
something that you are already familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, you have a lot of context to full back on. I might come across the
phrase &lt;span lang=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;組み分け帽子&lt;/span&gt; and upon checking the dictionary, would
discover that the first part (&lt;span lang=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;組み分け&lt;/span&gt;) means “division
into groups” and the second (&lt;span lang=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;帽子&lt;/span&gt;) means “hat”. Without any
knowledge of Harry Potter, this is quite a cryptic phrase and could leave you
scratching your head for a while. For those of us that know the story, it’s easy
to recognise “Oh, it’s the Sorting Hat!” This meant I had no trouble with
made-up names and phrases (which there are a lot of in Harry Potter). These
nuggets of knowledge also acted as anchors in the story that would help me
verify if I was understanding the text correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-figure&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, I don’t have a great tolerance for ambiguity. I like to make sure I’m
understanding every sentence, every detail when I’m taking something in. This
sense of unease, that I’m missing something, is hard to overcome if you’re
reading in a language you’re not confident in. Better to start with a tale you
already know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I also got my hands on a beautiful illustrated version of the book
which has charming depictions of the magical world on every other page. This,
again, helped set the scene and gave me clues to how the story was developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-figure&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tracking my progress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided I would track my progress during my time reading Harry Potter. Things
I wanted to track included how many kanji and words I was looking up as well as
how long it was taking me to read each page. I knew I would be slow, much much
slower than if I was reading in English so I needed a way to keep motivated.
Having visibility over my improvement over time became that motivator. Knowing
that, even if I’m going at a snail’s pace reading this children’s book, I am at
least a lot faster than when I started out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would I track these stats? Whenever I sat down to read Harry Potter, I used
a stopwatch to record how long I was reading for. I also had a spreadsheet where
I would enter each word or kanji I looked up. After each reading session, I
would fill in the number of pages I read, the length of time, and the number of
lookups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-figure&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was all fairly manual. At some point I would like to build an app that
automates a lot of this for me. &lt;small&gt;But this might just sit atop my list of
projects that I never actually start. &lt;span role=&quot;img&quot; aria-label=&quot;See-No-Evil Monkey&quot;&gt;🙈&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How long it took me&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;75 reading sessions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;62 hours&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Across 2 months&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How many lookups&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3366 unique words / 4738 total words&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;565 unique kanji / 975 total kanji&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it took me a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;long time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to read Harry Potter and the
Philosopher’s Stone. To put it into perspective, I could have read over ten
English novels in that time. But I expected that going into this journey. What I
was more concerned about was whether I became a better reader over those 62
hours. And the answer was a definitive &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:880px&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first page took me an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;hour and a half&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to read. But I improved quickly
and dramatically. My average reading speed reduced to 51 minutes per page by the
end of the first chapter. In the final chapter, I was reading at a pace of 11
minutes a page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:880px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of lookups tells a similar story. The first chapter had me looking up
an average of 45 words and 14 kanji per page. Whereas, in the final chapter, I
only needed to look up 13 words and 3 kanji per page. The decreased rate of
lookups wasn’t the only reason my reading speed was increasing either. I was
also getting better at distinguishing individual words within a sentence and
acclimatising myself to the grammar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing I hadn’t predicted was my stamina growth. I started off only being
able to read half a page at a time. Despite being very motivated (it was what
the previous six months were leading up to after all), I found it draining
enough that I needed to take a break after 30-40 minutes. By chapter ten, I
could read whole chapters in a single sitting, spending almost three hours doing
so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, progress wasn’t always linear. I clearly had some setbacks. Notably, in
chapter eight, we spend a lot of time with the infamous Severus Snape. His style
of speech was a lot harder to decipher than the other characters, not least
because of his liberal use of obscure kanji.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-figure&quot;&gt;

    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-figcaption&quot;&gt;Professor, I’m trying my best!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was an important lesson I learned. From chapter to chapter, page to page,
even sentence to sentence, the difficulty of the text you’re reading is going to
fluctuate. And yet, it’s easy to lose sight of that in the moment. You might
read a difficult text and think you’re not making any headway. But if you take a
step back to view your journey over a wider time frame, it’s easy to see that
you really are making progress. Tracking my stats helped me to gain that
perspective. I could recognise that chapter eight was just a bump in the road
(or spike in the graph) in my quest to get better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I am pretty pleased with the progress I made. Not all of it is going to
translate to the next book I read (I’ll be surprised if I come across as many
breeds of owls any time soon). But there should be some knowledge that carries
over - common words and kanji, familiarity with grammar, and perhaps most
importantly, the confidence that no matter how painful a book is to start with,
I can make significant strides if I stick with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:880px&quot;&gt;
